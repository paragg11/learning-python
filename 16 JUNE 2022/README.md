## DOUBTS
```
- In CSCI lecture 6, unable to solve last problem, I'm getting the required output but not upto the mark.

Write a short program that asks the user to input two numbers where one of them must be greater than 10 and the other must be less than or equal to 10. It does not matter which is which. If both inputs are greater than 10, the program should output the error message “Both are above 10.” If both are less than or equal 10, the program should output the message “Both are below 10.” If the one of the numbers is above 10 and the other is less than or equal to 10, no message should be output. Regardless of any messages, the program should then output the average of the two numbers, accurate to 2 decimals. This program must use one if, one elif and no else. Note: just like in HW 1, the program should output a value immediately after reading it. Also, if you are having problems matching our output format, explore the difference between the output of the following two lines

print("{:.2f}".format(112.099))
print(round(112.099, 2))

MY SOLUTION:

	n = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    print(n)
    m = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
    print(m)

    if (n >= 11) or (m >= 11):
        print("Both are above 10.")
    elif n < 10 or m < 10:
        print("Both are below 10.")

    avg = (n + m)/2
    print("Average of two nos is ", round(avg,2))            #TODO - how to write without else

```
