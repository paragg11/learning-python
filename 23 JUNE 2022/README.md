## FIRST HALF

- ðŸš§ CSCI Lecture 8. 
- ðŸš§ Reading more on Using generic class-based views
```
Using the mixin classes we've rewritten the views to use slightly less code than before, 
but we can go one step further. REST framework provides a set of already mixed-in generic 
views that we can use to trim down our views.py module even more.

class SnippetList(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Snippet.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SnippetSerializer


class SnippetDetail(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    queryset = Snippet.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SnippetSerializer
```
