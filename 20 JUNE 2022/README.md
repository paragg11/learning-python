## FIRST HALF

- âœ… CSCI Lecture 7
- ðŸš§ CSCI Lecture 8. 
- ðŸš§ Django - Passbook project successfully implemented admin 
```
- To add, edit and delete the posts we've just modeled, we will use Django admin.

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import User

admin.site.register(User)

As you can see, we import (include) the User model defined. To make our model visible on the admin page, we need to register the model with admin.site.register(User)

## ASSIGNMENT

- [Passbook](https://github.com/sp18-interns/django-passbook)

## DOUBTS

- Was stuck for long time as code was running in infinite loop, resolved by understanding the correct flow as I mixed up with urls of project passbook and urls of app user and also silly naming convention mistake.
