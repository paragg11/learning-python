```
- Setting up new environment
- creating a model to work with
- creating a serializer class
- Working with serializer

    It's important to remember that ModelSerializer classes don't do anything particularly magical, they are simply a shortcut for creating serializer classes:
    - An automatically determined set of fields.
    - Simple default implementations for the create() and update() methods.
