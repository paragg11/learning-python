```
Request Objects

- The core functionality of the Request object is the
  request.data attribute, which is similar to request.POST

Response objects

- REST framework also introduces a Response object, which is
  a type of TemplateResponse that takes unrendered content and
  uses content negotiation to determine the correct content 
  type to return to the client.

Status codes

- REST framework provides more explicit identifiers for each
  status code, such as HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST in the status 
  module.

Wrapping API views

- The @api_view decorator for working with function based 
  views.
- The APIView class for working with class-based views.
